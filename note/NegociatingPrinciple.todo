☐ Control talking flow and topics should be talked

The Harvard Principles of Negotiation:
    ☐ [Keep away from the target struggle issue] Seperate the people from issue.
    ☐ [Interest-level differential] Negociate not position focused but INTEREST-oriented (win-win)
    ☐ [Must required] Developer criteria that a solution must fulfill (win-win)
    ☐ [More options] You should have different options to choose from
