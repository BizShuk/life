# One week trip in Taiwan


Taiwan has great spectacular scenaries. One week is definitely not enough to explore it.
With convenience, I force this trips on north of Taiwan and some the most significant scenaries in Taiwan (not just Taipei, 2 days expected from Taipei). In Taiwan, we don't use credit card a lot. So, please exchange some cashes($50~$100/week) in advance. In Taipei, it has easy card solution. it was heavily used in Taiwan (Transpotation and Convenient Store, but not vendors).

### Food level guide
    In Taiwan, we have very cheaper food around $1-5 in our daily. $10 can buy you a decent meal. $20-$30 is excellent, like grilled restaurant or high-class restaurant. Above $30, only few of them, probably, hotel restaurant. If you don't know whether the food is good or not, just follow queued up one.
