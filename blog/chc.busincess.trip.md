# Business Proposal

Hi

In this email, I'd like to propose the business trip for myself. 
The purpose of this trip is not for coding in US office. It is for sychronizing between CHC and TDC.
As everyone knew, CIH team has been more than one year in TDC. We run Scrum, and most of meetings hold are based on tasks. In the meetings, discussing tasks is more eaiser through video or voice call, even though 
there are some hiccups needed to communicate back and forth. There is also something which is not eaiser to be discussed and is not required for outcomes. It needs to be preached and propagated times, and then it will help progresses overall. 

Why hasn't it worked before? Because no one will join a video call or voice call without explicit tasks.

In this trip, there are things important I think.
- To know IHP platform more, ex: schedule, design, how CIH intergrate with.
- To talk to Karthik, Enan to understand the perspective of their duties
- To talk to Mark the understand the organization structure and relationship.
- To Have chats with cloud team about how they do their jobs and designs.
- To assist the communication of software part of EFT project.

PS: This email were send to Karthik, Enan, Subba, Jazz, Clestus, and Lucy. I didn't send to Mark. I know he is the boss of CIH team, but I don't think this email should be sent to Mark directly. If it might works, please have a conversation with Mark(by Karthik, Enan, Subba, or Jazz)
